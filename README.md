# Thumbnails Creator

The thumbnails creator project.

This program should be able to run on Windows and Android, at least.  
It may be able to run on other platforms, too, but I don't have them.

## Run

Changes folder to:

	cd %SOURCE%/apps.thumbnails-creator/thumbnails_creator

Run:

	flutter run -d windows
